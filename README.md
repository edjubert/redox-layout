This keymap is **a work in progress**, and is meant to be used on macOS.
I use this keymap with a Colemak input layout of MacOS. I'm also working on the Colemak version.

## Layers

My layout uses 5 layers:

1. The default base layer, using [QWERTY].
2. A Symbol layer, so dev specific symbols are accessible from the home row.
3. A Navigation / Media layer, with both sound control, mouse and arrows on the home row. (bottom right legends)
4. An international layer (_inter), empty for the moment.
5. A keyboard control layer, not pictured here, allowing me to control the LED lighting as well as the keyboard debug functions.

This layout is available [here](https://github.com/edjubert/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/redox/keymaps/edjubert).
There is a Colemak version available [here](https://github.com/edjubert/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/redox/keymaps/edjubert_colemak).

This is a customization of Jeherve available [here](https://github.com/jeherve/redox-layout).
